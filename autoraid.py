#Simple example on how to connect to and send commands to the sys module.
#The example is for Pokemon Sword/Shield, it reads a .ek8 file from a certain file path, injects it into box1slot1
#and starts a surprise trade with the given pokemon. It waits a certain amount of time (hoping the trade has completed)
#before retrieving the new pokemon. Finally it extracts the pokemons .ek8 data from the game and saves it to the hard drive.
#The script assumes the game is set up in a way that the character is not currently in any menus and that the cursor of the
#pokebox is on box1slot1.

#The script isn't exactly robust, there are many ways to make it better (for example one could compare the box1slot1 data in
#RAM with that of the pokemon sent to see if a trade has been found and if not back out of the menu to search for another 10 
#seconds or so instead of waiting a fixed 45 seconds), but it is rather meant as a showcase of the functionalites of the 
#sysmodule anyway.

#Commands:
#make sure to append \r\n to the end of the command string or the switch args parser might not work
#responses end with a \n (only poke has a response atm)
